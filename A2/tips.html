    <h1>How to start?</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Set aside time each day to practice</li>
        <p> You should try to set aside at least 20 minutes minimum to practice — the more you can practice the better. If you do have more time available, 
            try breaking your practice into 20 minute intervals throughout the day so it does not feel too daunting.</p>
        <li>Warm up</li>
        <p>
            Have you ever tried to send a text message while your fingers were freezing? It is nearly impossible to type quickly and without mistakes because
            your fingers are stiff. The same goes for playing the piano. It is important to warm up your hands and fingers so you can fluidly play the keys. 
            This is especially important when you are learning because you will stumble upon enough mistakes even without clunky stiff fingers!
        </p>
        <li>Do not take up too much</li>
        <p>
            Unless you are a piano virtuoso, it is highly unlikely that you will be able to master an arrangement the first time you play it. Instead of taking 
            on the entire piece, break it down into manageable sections. Depending on your level of ability, this can range from just one measure to one page. 
            Whatever you or your teacher decide is achievable for you, set your practice goal and stick to it.
        </p>
        <li>Avoid the tendency to always start at the beginning</li>
        <p>
            The very beginning is not always a good place to start. When you start at the beginning each time you sit down to practice, you only master the beginning 
            before your allotted practice time is up… without ever giving yourself time to tackle that difficult section.
        </p>
        <li>Practice Slowly</li>
        <p>
            Rushing through the piece means that you might make mistakes, and then you run the risk of learning those mistakes. Instead, play each note deliberately 
            until you are sure of your fingering. With most digital keyboards, you can even record at a practice tempo and play back at a faster tempo to see how it will
            sound when you have mastered the song.
        </p>
        <li>Listen to the song when you are not playing it</li>
        <p>
            Knowing the tune of a song can often help your fingers move along the keys. Download the song you are trying to master onto your smartphone or tablet and listen 
            to it often — even when you are away from the piano. Having the song in your head can also help get you inspired to sit down at the piano and practice it yourself.
        </p>
        <li>Pick a piece that <strong>you</strong> want to play </li>
        <p>
            It may seem obvious, but you are far more likely to practice a song that you like. After all, you are going to be playing the song over and over, so make sure it
            is something that you want to hear!
        </p>
