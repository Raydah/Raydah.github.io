    <h1>Styles</h1>
    <p>There are many many different styles of playing the piano. However, I will only be going theough 4</p>
    <h2>1. Classical</h2>
    <p>
        Classical music is the most diverse genre of piano music. It is considered one of the oldest genres and is credited with laying the foundation 
        for music education. Playing classical music successfully requires several skills and techniques: piano theory, patience, and an understanding 
        of a diverse set of skills.
        It is often the first instrument that students learn since it requires them to have an excellent technique and a thorough understanding of music 
        theory. It is challenging to acquire and expert other piano genres without first understanding classical piano techniques. This is because most 
        of the music derives from the classical style. Types of piano music you can play on the classical piano are Canon in D, Prelude No.1 in C, Sonata 
        in C Major, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Moonlight Sonata, FÃ¼r Elise and many others.

    <h2>2. Rhytm and Blues</h2>
    <p>
        This style of piano music is played in combination with blues, jazz, and gospel. The emphasis is on the rhythm, highlighted by its name.
        They usually have a powerful sense of syncopation, which involves the placement of unstressed beats under stressed beats. Playing Rhythm 
        and Blues Piano Music makes it possible for you to master the tempo and rhythm. Many modern piano styles are based on Rhythm and Blues.
        The 12-bar blues is a simple chord pattern used in many blues compositions. The blues rely heavily on the major and minor pentatonic scales, 
        with an extra note thrown in for good measure. The blues scale is made by adding a flatted fifth to the minor pentatonic.
        The I, IV, and V chords of a scale are used to lay the groundwork for melodies and solos. Rock piano, for example, arose from the blues and 
        then took on a life of its thanks to the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, Michael McDonald, Elton John, Billy Joel, and others.
