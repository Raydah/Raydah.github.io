        <h1>Styles</h1>
        <p>There are many many different styles of playing the piano. However, I will only be going theough 4</p>
        <h2>1. Classical</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout 1750-1820, classical piano was performed for royalty and the upper class in Europe. There were three main composers who paved 
            the way for classical piano composition: Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven.
            As the years progressed and classical music transformed from renaissance to baroque and romantic, other great pianists emerged, including 
            Haydn, Chopin, Handel, Wagner, Debussy, and Tchaikovsky.
            Classical piano is often what students study first because it forces them to have a very strong technique and knowledge of music theory.
            Without having an understanding of theclassical piano technique, it is very hard to learn and pick up otherpiano styles. That is because most
            music has stemmed from the classical style.                                                                     
        </p>
        <div class="Mozart">
            <p>
                One famous classical pianist that most people might know is Wolfgang Amadeua Mozart. As a composer, Mozart needs no introduction and is one of 
                the most well-known and prolific composers of the classical era.
                But, he was also an incredible pianist and was performing for audiences at the age of 5 and was considered by many as a child prodigy.
                His sister Nannerl (yes, he had a sister and an equally talented one at that) once described his playing during his childhood as "faultless and 
                with the greatest delicacy." His compositional brilliance and legacy of piano classics have influenced most piano players in some way or another.
                One of his pieces is Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. Never heard of it? Well click on his image below to hear a few songs from Mozart.

        <h2>2. Rhythm and Blues</h2>
        <p>
            This style of piano music is played in combination with blues, jazz, and gospel. The emphasis is on the rhythm, highlighted by its name.
            They usually have a powerful sense of syncopation, which involves the placement of unstressed beats under stressed beats. Playing Rhythm 
            and Blues Piano Music makes it possible for you to master the tempo and rhythm. Many modern piano styles are based on Rhythm and Blues.
            The 12-bar blues is a simple chord pattern used in many blues compositions. The blues rely heavily on the major and minor pentatonic scales, 
            with an extra note thrown in for good measure. The blues scale is made by adding a flatted fifth to the minor pentatonic.
            The I, IV, and V chords of a scale are used to lay the groundwork for melodies and solos. Rock piano, for example, arose from the blues and 
            then took on a life of its thanks to the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, Michael McDonald, Elton John, Billy Joel, and others.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Jazz</h2>
        <p>
            1918 marked the big start of American jazz and it still remains one of the most popularpiano styles. Pianists such as Scott Joplin, Jelly Roll Morton,
            and Fats Waller are piano players influential in building the jazz scene around New York, Chicago, and New Orleans.
            At the time,jazz pianowas a rebellious type of music, as it deviated from the classic rhythms, harmony, and technique.
            Jazz music incorporates swing, improvisation,ragtime, boogie-woogie, and bee-bop to create captivating melodies and rhythmic patterns.
            People turned to jazz music during “The Great Depression” as well as in times of celebration.
    `       It also became an important mark in history where African-Americans, Asians, Latinos, and Europeans were able to come together to create music in America.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Pop/Rock</h2>
        <p>
            Starting in the 1950s, piano was incorporated in many popular pop and rock songs. In the 1970s, the keyboard was heavily introduced because of its cool electric 
            sounds.
            Being a contemporaryrock/pop pianoplayer and composer is no easy task, but is one of the most rewarding piano gigs around.
            Pop/rock is one of the highest-payingpiano stylesaround. As a piano player, you will probably find the most paid work, ranging from cover bands, wedding gigs, 
            session recordings, and touring performances.
            With this piano style, you are free to explore new sounds, as the charts are always changing. Moreover, having the ability to both sing and play the piano looks 
            and sounds great in performance.
